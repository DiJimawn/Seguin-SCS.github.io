# IDEs
Integrated Developement Evironment
An IDE is a piece of software application that helps the programer develop software  code efficiently. Most integrated development environments include functionality that goes beyond text editing. They provide a central interface for common developer tools, making the software development process much more efficent.
* Code editing automation
* Syntax highlighting
* Intelligent code completion
* Refactoring support
* Local build automation
* Compilation
* Testing
* Debugging

1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Replit.com (https://replit.com/)
3. IntelliJ IDEA (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

# Github
## Github Link (https://github.com/)
Github is a website and cloud-base service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.

## Version Control?
Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project's code. 
Version control lets developers safely work through __*branching*__ and __*merging*__. With __*branching*__, a develop duplicates part of the source code (called the __*repository*__). The develop can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project.
Once the develop gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can __*merge*__ that code back into the main source code to make it offical.
